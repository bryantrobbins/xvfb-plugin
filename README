This is a plugin for Jenkins-CI (http://jenkins-ci.org) that starts Xvfb (http://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) with the start of the job, and stops it when the job is done.

This fork by Bryan Robbins will attempt to allow the display number to be determined by the build # of the Jenkins job.
This feature is necessary in a use case of having multiple SSH slaves on the same physical box. The current default
of using executor number as display name causes duplicates in this case, as each SSH slave has its own executors.
